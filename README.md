# ArtAppGame
###### Joan Chirinos, June 2018

To start, I'd like to give credit to Darren Liang for the game idea/mechanics, images, choices, and music.

I ported a game made by Darren Liang (to study for Art Appreciation, a class in Stuyvesant High School) into a website that uses HTML+CSS and Javascript.

Unfortunately, the answers may not be correct (as of 6-11-2018). Darren has agreed to work on that and update me and his game as soon as possible.

You may download the original Python game [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m-UXsaMIhHgIZhcAeVBbkCc0diOUIGxF/view)
